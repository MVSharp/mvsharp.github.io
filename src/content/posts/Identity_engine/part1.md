# Motivation

Developing a robust identification system is crucial for industries such as security, banking, and border control. These systems automate the verification of identity documents like ID cards and passports, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error. By leveraging OpenCV's powerful image processing capabilities, we can create a solution that accurately detects and validates key features of identification documents, ensuring secure and reliable authentication.

## Background knowledge of Id Card And Passport

ID cards and passports are critical for identity verification, incorporating advanced security features to prevent forgery. For instance, Macau ID cards include holographic elements, microtext, and UV-reactive patterns. To check authenticity, systems analyze these features under specific lighting conditions or use machine-readable zones (MRZ) for data extraction. Techniques like pattern matching and optical character recognition (OCR) in OpenCV help verify details such as serial numbers, barcodes, or embedded chips, ensuring the document is genuine.

## MRZ In IdCard

The Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) is a standardized section on ID cards and passports, typically consisting of two lines of text in a fixed-width font. For ID cards, like the Macau ID, the MRZ encodes essential information such as the holder's name, document number, nationality, date of birth, and expiration date. This data is formatted according to international standards (e.g., ICAO Doc 9303), ensuring compatibility with automated systems worldwide. The MRZ's structured layout allows OpenCV-based systems to use OCR to extract data reliably, even under varying image conditions. By verifying the MRZ's check digits and cross-referencing with other document features, such as UV patterns or embedded chips, the system can confirm the ID's authenticity, making it a cornerstone of secure identification.

# System Design

1. **User Interaction**: The user opens the program, which detects connected scanners and drivers.
2. **Document Scanning**: The program prompts the user to place the document in the scanner. The scanner captures White, UV, and IR images.
3. **Multi-Page Handling**: If the document has multiple pages, the program notifies the user to flip the document for additional scans.
4. **Image Processing and Verification**: The program preprocesses and post-processes images, identifies the document type, performs zone-based analysis, and validates authenticity.
5. **Result Display**: The verification result is shown to the user, typically as a score or pass/fail status.

# Image Process Design

![imageproc](./imageproc.svg)
The system processes images to determine document validity. Below is the flow in pseudocode:

```plaintext
if image is not >= 80% black then
    preprocess image (rotate, scale, color normalization)
    postprocess image (cut into zones, label zone types)
    identify document type
    for each zone:
        retrieve processing method from database (template matching, color space hashing, or feature detection)
        apply method and assign step scores
    sum step scores to calculate final verification score
```

# OCR

Reading Image Text , we may choose **PaddleOCR** or **Tessert** or some other , not that important

## Image Processing with OpenCV

### Preprocessing

- **Rotate**: Align the document using edge detection (e.g., Hough Transform).
- **Scale**: Resize to a standard resolution for consistent processing.
- **Color Normalization**: Adjust brightness and contrast for White, UV, and IR images to standardize output across scanners.

### Postprocessing

- **Zone Cutting**: Segment the image into predefined zones (e.g., VISUAL, BARCODE, MRZ, RFID, MAGSTRIPE).
- **Processing Methods**: Retrieve methods from the database:
  - **Template Matching**: Compare zones with known templates using normalized cross-correlation.
  - **Color Space Hashing**: Hash images in YCrCb color space for comparison.
  - **Feature Detection**: Use algorithms like SIFT or ORB to identify key points.

## Possible ID Card Zones

- **VISUAL**: Logos, photos, or holograms.
- **BARCODE**: QR codes or barcodes for encoded data.
- **MRZ**: Machine-readable zone for passports/ID cards, varying by country.
- **RFID**: Embedded chip data (if supported by scanner).
- **MAGSTRIPE**: Magnetic stripe data (if applicable).

## Scanner Output

Scanners produce:

- **White Image**: Visible light scan for text and visual elements.
- **Infrared (IR) Image**: Highlights security features like IR ink.
- **Ultraviolet (UV) Image**: Reveals fluorescent patterns or overlays.

### Supported Hardware

Example scanners include:

- AssureTec_ID150,
- **AT9000MK2**,
- AT10Ki,
- ISI221,
- **AT9000MK1**,
- AT10K,
- KR9000,
- QS1000,
- Desko_ID1Go,
- HaSoInTech_ID600S,
- AssureTec_ID1501,
- CR5400,
- IST220,
- IST221,
- ISI300,
- ISI222,
- Regula_72X3,

- Witek_XID100,
- ESeek_M500,
- Desko_Penta,
- Desko_Icon,
- AccessIS_ATOM,
- AccessIS_ADR100,

### Example Driver

- **3M AT9000**: A common scanner driver for capturing White, UV, and IR images.

## Verification Steps

Each step outputs a score, contributing to the final verification ratio:

- **PatternMatch**: Template matching for known patterns.
- **Presence**: Check for expected elements (e.g., hologram).
- **UVOverlay**: Validate UV-specific overlays.
- **CrossMatch**: Compare data across White, UV, and IR images.
- **DataValidation**: OCR-based validation of MRZ, country code, birthdate, expiry date, and age.
- **InvalidPattern**: Detect tampered or incorrect patterns.
- **NonPattern**: Identify missing expected patterns.

## Normalization for Scanner Output

- **IR Normalization**: Adjust for varying IR sensitivity across scanners (shifting, scaling, gamma correction).
- **UV Normalization**: Standardize UV fluorescence intensity.

## Template Matching and Feature Detection

- **Template Matching**: Use OpenCVâ€™s `cv2.matchTemplate` in YCrCb color space for robust comparison.
- **Feature Detection**: Apply SIFT/ORB for keypoint matching in White, UV, and IR images.

## Data Validation

OCR extracts text from zones (e.g., MRZ) and validates:

- **MRZ**: Check format and checksum for country-specific standards.
- **Country Code, Birthdate, Expiry Date, Age**: Cross-verify with database or computed values.

## Authentication Tests

- **PatternMatch**: Match against stored templates.
- **UV_Presence/NonPresence**: Confirm UV elements.
- **FeatureDetection**: Validate keypoints.
- **UV_OverlayDetection**: Check UV-specific security features.
- **Invalid_Pattern_Detection**: Flag anomalies.
